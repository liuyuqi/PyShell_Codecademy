What is a shell?

A shell is generally an interface in which you interact with the operating system. It can use either CLI (command-line interface) or GUI (graphical user interface). But when people talk about shells, it usually refers to command-line terminals. Users type in commands and the shell interpretes it as well as passing the task to the operating system to execute it.

Your task in this course is to write a CLI shell using Python! Python provides the os package, making it very convenient to invoke system calls in python! As you will see, it can be written in just a little over 200 lines of python code, although it's just a simple working shell skeleton!

The code window shows what a working shell looks like. You can also open your own terminal, whether you're using Mac, Linux/Unix or Windows.
