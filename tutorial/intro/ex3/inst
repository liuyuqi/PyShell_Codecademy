Input

Output is not enough. As an interactive shell, we definitely need inputs!

Python provides the `raw_input` function to allow us collect user's input from the keyboard. 

It's easy! For example, we could store the user's input into `cmd_input` variable like this:

    prompt = "Please type here: "
    cmd_input = raw_input("prompt")

Note that the prompt is printed on the screen too. So, there's no need to `print` the `prompt` any more.

Exercise:

Like the example above:
1. print the prompt on the screen and take user's input, using only the `raw_input` function. Save the user's input in a variable called `cmd_input`, then 
2. print `cmd_input` back on the screen.

SCT:
if type(error) == NameError:
    return "Ooops, it seems that you used a variable that you never defined."
if code.count("raw_input") == 0:
	return "It seems that you didn't use the raw_input function?"

try:
    studentIn = cmd_input
except NameError:
    return "make sure you stored your input into the cmd_input variable!"
else:
    studentOut = CC.prints()
    if studentOut[-1] != studentIn:
        return "Your output is different from your input. Did you print the correct variable?"
    
return True
