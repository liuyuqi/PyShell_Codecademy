output

From now on, we're going to review some important things in Python that may help build your shell.

A shell needs to output the prompt. What is a prompt? You'll see in this exercise.

By using the print statement, you can easily output the desired text to the terminal. Like this:

print "Hello, world!"

In this exercise, we're going to print a prompt on the screen.

Exercise:
1. Remember how to format the text? Please fill in the blanks to make prompt equals to "user [/home]> ".
2. Print prompt on the screen.


script:
if code.count("username") < 2 or code.count("cwd") < 3:
	return "Make sure you used the two variables in the submission."
if CC.printed('user [/home]> ') == False:
	return "The output of terminal is not correct, please check your code~~"
return True
