Loops

You don't expect your shell to take only one command and exit, right? A shell should be always running unless the user let it go. Therefore, we need a loop to keep it running.

Since we want it to be an "infinite loop" -- obviously an infinite loop (of course, with an exit) is not always bad, especially in our case. A `while` loop is good here:

    while True:
        # do something here
        if user_input == "exit":
            break

exercise:

Add a while loop where you think it's the right spot. The loop body should be *print the prompt, take user's input, and print the command.* 

Like the example above, please add an exit to the loop. You don't want to run your shell without being able to terminate it.

Notice that the indentation applies to the loop body!

When you're done, click `Save & Submit Code` to test your code. If you think the loop works fine, type `exit` and press enter to continue.


SCT:

if user_input.strip() != "exit":
    return "Your loop doesn't seem right. The program exits before you typed 'exit'."
if type(error) == SyntaxError or type(error) == NameError:
    return "Please check your code."

return True
