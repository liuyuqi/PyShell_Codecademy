Now let's start!

In a shell, there's something we always concern about. The first concern is, who logged in this shell? That is, what is the user's username who logged in?

*Do you still remember the `prompt`? It's like
`user [/home]> `*

There are lots of ways to get the current logged-in user's username. But here in Codecademy, we'll get the user's id instead. `uid` is a distinct number that identifies a user in a system.

We can easily get the user's `uid` by calling `getuid` method in the `os` module. Remember the way to call an `os` method? 
    os.getuid()


exercise:

1. Get the current `uid` by using `os.getuid`, and store the value in a variable called `cuid`.

2. print the value of `cuid` on the screen.

Don't forget to `import os` before you call any of its method!

SCT:

import os
if type(error) == NameError:
    if code.count('import os') == 0:
        return "Did you remember to import the os module?"
    elif code.count('os.getuid()') == 0 and code.count('getuid()') > 0:
        return "Did you call 'getuid()' instead of 'os.getuid()'?"
    elif code.count('getuid') > 0 and code.count('getuid()') == 0:
        return "You probably lost the parenthesis as calling a method!"

uid = os.getuid()
if uid != cuid:
    return "You're not getting the correct uid!"
return True
