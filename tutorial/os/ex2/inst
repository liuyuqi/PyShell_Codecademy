os.getlogin()

Do you still remember the `prompt`? It's like
`user [/home]> `

in which `user` is the current login user's username, and `/home` is the current working directory. We do need to care about those two variables.

Getting the current login user is simple, just use the `getlogin()` method in the `os` module.

    import os
    username = os.getlogin()
